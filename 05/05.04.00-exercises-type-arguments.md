# Type arguments answers:

worth keeping in mind:

* there are classes in haskell like `Num`

* classes can have instances like `Integer`


## 1
`f :: a -> a -> a -> a`

type of `a` is `Char` that is: `f a :: Char -> Char -> Char`

answer: `Char -> Char -> Char`

because `a` is a type of `Char`

## 2
`g :: a -> b -> c -> b`

`g 0 'c' "woot"`

answer: Char

because argument `'c'` - `b` in the type signature is type of Char

## 3
`h :: (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b`

`h 1.0 2`

answer: `Num b => b`

because the function returns `b` and `b` is of class `Num` (more specific type is defined in #4)

## 4
`h :: (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b`

`h 1 (5.5 :: Double)`

answer: `Double`

because it's the same principle as #3 but in this case the type is more specific than a `Num` class it's a `Double`

## 5
`jackal :: (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a`

`jackal "keyboard" "has the word jackal in it"`

answer: `[Char]`

because the function returns `"keyboard"` and that's the list of characters hence the `[Char]`

## 6
`jackal :: (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a`

`jackal "keyboard"`

answer: `Eq => b -> [Char]`

because it's partly applied function that returns `a` that is `Char`, but it's only partly applied so we need the `b` part, in this case `Eq b => b`

## 7
`kessel :: (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a`

`kessel 1 2`

answer: `(Ord a, Num a) => a`

because `a` that is `1` is not specific enough therefore polymorphic types `(Ord a, Num a)` apply, `Ord a` is from the function signature and `Num a` because that's how haskell handles numbers, so it's taken both from the function and the language

## 8
`kessel :: (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a`

`kessel 1 (2 :: Integer)`

answer: `(Ord a, Num a) => a` 

because principle from #7 applies

## 9
`kessel :: (Ord a,Num b) => a -> b -> a`

`kessel (1 :: Integer) 2`

answer: Integer

because `a` has a class of `Num` but in this case it was specified as `Integer`
