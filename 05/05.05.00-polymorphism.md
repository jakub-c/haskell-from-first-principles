# Polymorphism

There are two types of polymorphic types in haskell:

* parametric polymorphism
* constrained polymorphism

`id :: a -> a` is an example of a parametric polymorphic function (a can be anything)
`Num a => a -> a` is a constrained polymorphism because a is constrained be a typeclass `Num`

"A function is polymorphic if its type signature has variables that can represent more than one type"
