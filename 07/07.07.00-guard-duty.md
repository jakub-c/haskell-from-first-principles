# Guard duty

1. `| otherwise = 'F'` as the first match would make the function always return 'F' because all arguments fall for the 'otherwise' category
2. moving matches around would also alter the result of the function evaluation: `| y >= 0.7 = 'C' ` as the first match would catch everything `>= 0.7` so all other more specific matches like `| y >= 0.9 = 'A'` wouldn't be executed
