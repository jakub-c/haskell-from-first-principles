# Chapter definitions

1. **Binding** - associating variable to a value, parameter to a function argument
2. **Anonymous function** - function that's not bound to an identifier
3. **Currying** - 'nesting' functions, a function that takes one parameter and returning function
4. **Pattern matching** - this needs a better definition, but for now: specifying the result of the function based on given parameters, it's a different incarnation of if-else statement
5. **Bottom** - a term used to describe a program that can not return a value of a result - for example it's stuck in an infinite recursion
6. **Higher order function** - a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function
7. **Function composition** - application of a result of one function to another function, composition is a **higher order function**
8. **Pointfree** - a convention where you skip the function arguments, they are applied to functions with **currying**
