# Bottom

> ⊥ or bottom is a term used in Haskell to refer to computations that do not successfully result in a value. In logic, ⊥ corresponds to *false*

Examples of bottom:

* `let x = x in x` - short circuit - results an an exception
* `f True = error "some error"` - results as an exception
* partial function - if we declare:
  ```
  f :: Bool -> Int
  f False = 0
  ```
     that results as: `Non-exhaustive patterns in function f` - that's bottom. Possible fix: use `_` - `otherwise` operator `f _ =` to handle the missing cases

## Partial / total function definitions

**Partial function** - one that doesn't handle all it's possible inputs, like in the example above
**Total function** - is the opposite - it handles all the possible inputs

## Rewrite of the previous partial function
```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
f :: Bool -> Maybe Int
f False = Just 0
f _ = Nothing
```
