# Review of types

1. `[[True,False],[True,True],[False,True]]` has type of `[[Bool]]`

2. `[[True, False], [True, True], [False, True]]` has the same type as ` [[3==3], [6>5], [3<4]]` that is `[[Bool]]`

3. All statements in the question are true
  ```func :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
  func x y = x ++ y
  ```
  * `x` and `y` must be the same type
  * `x` and `y` must be both lists
  * if `x`  is a String then `y` must be a string String

4. `func "Hello" "World"` other types would work too like `func [1,2,3] [3,4,5]`
