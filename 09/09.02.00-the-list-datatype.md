```haskell
data []   a   =  []   |   a : [a]
--   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  [6]
```

1. The datatype with the constructor `[]`
2. takes a single type constructor argument `a`
3. at the term level can be constructed via
4. nullary constructor `[]`
5. or it can be constructed by
6. data constructor `(:)` which is a product of a value of the type `a` we mentioned in the type constructor and a value of type `[a]`, that is, "more list"
