# List's syntax

this is syntactic sugar
```haskell
[1, 2, 3] ++ [4]
-- [1,2,3,4]
```

for this
```haskell
(1 : 2 : 3 : []) ++ 4 : []
-- [1,2,3,4]
```

values are connected through the successive application of *cons* `(:)` 

in lists we talk about **cons cells** and **spines**

desugared version takes data type's second data constructor `a : [a]` and recursively appends its value to *more list*. The **cons cell** is a *conceptual* space that values may inhabit. The *spine* is a connective structure that holds the **cons cells** together.
